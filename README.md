- Android :
 
`VerusCoinMiner9000` For Android smatphone and tablettes by @shmutalov aka Lukeisky Get it [Here](https://docs.verus.io/economy/start-mining.html#mobile) Or [Here](https://github.com/shmutalov/VerusMiner9000/releases)


- I0S :
 
`CCminer-IOS` ,The IOS version brought by @MR-Bossman aka #Jess , Head up to  his github repo [here](https://github.com/Mr-Bossman/CCminer-IOS/releases) and follow carefully the Instructions on the read-Me file.

- Command Line: üíª
 
There are two others methods (or more?), to compile ccminer on Android: The first method is installing a Linux distribution with help of [Termux + proot-distro](https://medium.com/veruscoin/mining-veruscoin-on-smartphone-208dbb06905f) described on the article .

The second methode is by compiling ccminer on Android  without any ch-rooted Linux distribution ,using a Terminal emulator Termux

Follow the step by step instructions

1- Download and install Termux from F-droid [here](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/)

or from the [Github release section under ‚ÄúAsset‚Äù](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases)

After a successful install launch the application We are going to Run all the commands inside the termux shell Window so keep it open until the end of compilation.

2- Install additional packages

  ```shell
  pkg install automake build-essential curl git gnupg openssl nano
  ```
 ```shell
apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libjansson-dev
automake autotools-dev build-essential
```

if after this command you get this error :
Package libjansson-dev is not available, but is referred to by another package. 
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available 
from another source However the following packages replace it: libjansson 
E: Unable to locate package libcurl4-openssl-dev 
E: Unable to locate package libssl-dev 
E: Package ‚Äòlibjansson-dev‚Äô has no installation candidate 
E: Unable to locate package autotools-dev

just remove them from the command and install the available or suggested ones like so

```shell
apt-get install  libjansson automake build-essential
```
this may not work on all systems just try to read the ouput error on the terminal and do some search

- Clone the ccminer git repo (ARM branch):

```shell
git clone --single-branch -b ARM https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer.git && cd ccminer
```
if you get no errors then you end on the ccminer folder,

Make Scripts Executables

```shell
chmod +x build.sh && chmod +x configure.sh && chmod +x autogen.sh
```

buid the miner binarie

```shell
./build.sh
```

if all go fine and End no errors we should find on the folder a fresh ccminer binaries ready for use .
